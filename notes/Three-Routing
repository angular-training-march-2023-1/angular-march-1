Routing can be done in 2 ways
------------------------------
1. using hyperlinks with routerLink ( DO NOT USE href)
    - here thr routing is done on the template
2. programatically - using Router
    - here the routing is done on the component class

steps in Routing
----------------
1. provide route paths for the components that you would want to route to
    This is done in app-routing.module.ts file, in the routes array
2. use the <router-outlet> tag to tell where the routed compoenent should be displayed
