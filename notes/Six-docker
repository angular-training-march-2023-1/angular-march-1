steps to dockerize this angular application in nginx server
----------------------------------------------------------
1. create a dockerfile 
    - because we want to create an image
    - when a  dockerfile is built we will get an image
2. build the dockerfile
            docker build -t my-ang-image .
    - building a dockerfile will result in an image
    - -t can be used to give a name for the image
    - confirm if the image my-ang-image is created by using docker images
3. run the image
            docker run --name my-ang-container -d -p 4444:80 my-ang-image
    - this will create a container with nginx server running inside the container
    - the defualt port 80 of nginx server inside the container is mapped to 4444 port on the local using -p 4444:80
    - the --name gives a name to the container
    - the -d runs the container detached mode
4. open a browser and type http://localhost:4444 and you should see you application
