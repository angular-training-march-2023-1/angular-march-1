1. Install NGINX server
2. next we have to deploy our angular application in nginx server
    2.1 First we have to build our angular application
                ng build
        this command will create a folder called dist and the built applicaiton is inside this folder
    2.2 Next copy the contents of dist/angular-march-1 folder into html folder of NGINX
    2.3 In NGINX folder's conf folder open nginx.conf file and paste the below lines
            server {
                    listen 6565;
                    server_name localhost;
                    location / {
                    root html;
                    index index.html index.htm;
                    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
                    }
                    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
                    location = /50x.html {
                    root html;
                    }
                    }
3. start the nginx server
        for this this doublic on the nginx apllication in nginx folder
4. now open a browser and type http://localhost:6565
        you should be able to access the angular application deployed in nginx server
