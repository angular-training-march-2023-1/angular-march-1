2 types of form
--------------
1. Template driven form
    - will create Add Student form using template driven form
    - here angular creates the FormControl object for your form/input elements
    - for this we use the ngModel directive in the template
    - we can create simple forms here
    - make sure to add FormsModule in app.module.ts file

2. Reactive form
    - will create Edit Student Form using Reactive Form
    - here we will create the FormControl object
    - so the coding starts from the component class, we will not use ngModel in the template
    - here we can create complex forms  - dynamically add or remove form elements from the form
    - make sure to add ReactiveFormsModule in app.module.ts file

concept
-------

<form>

</form>

- the moment we use the form tag in the template, angular creates a NgForm object internally
- we are going to get a reference to this NgForm object
- for getting a refrence we create a template variable for the form tag on the template
- and we equate it to ngForm
